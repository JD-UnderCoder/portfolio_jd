### 2. âœ… Background Animation - ADDED

- Particles move across the screen creating depth
- Works immediately - no video needed!

**Animations Added:**
1. **Gradient Shift** - Colors cycle through cyan â†’ purple â†’ magenta
2. **Particle Movement** - 6 glowing particles float across screen
3. **Opacity Pulse** - Background breathes with 0.3 â†’ 0.5 â†’ 0.3 opacity

**Result:** Stunning animated background that looks professional and futuristic RIGHT NOW!

You can still add a video for even more depth:

1. Download video from:
   - Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/videos/
   - Search: "technology background" or "digital particles"

2. Save as: `video/background.mp4`

3. Video will layer OVER the animated gradient for extra depth!
